Runnable files are "scripts/UAV_TESTER.py" and "scripts/USV_TESTER.py". To perform a test, both of these have to be running in their own terminal. The scripts communicate (quite inelegantly) with each other in ROS, so make sure that roscore is also running in a terminal. There's no need to understand these files, they are just executing specific tests I needed for the report. They are a bit of a mess.

The code is most easily understood by reading the files "scripts/UAV_simulation.py" and "scripts/USV_simulation", which contain the main classes for running the UAV simulation and USV simulation respectively. I have just cleaned up these files and they should be relatively straight-forward to understand. problemClasses.py is another important file, which defines classes used in UAV_simulation.py and USV_simulation.py. Most important settings are set in the file IMPORT_ME.py. I haven't tested using cvxgen in quite a while, but if one desired to use that solver, one needs to change the settings in IMPORT_ME.py as well as start the appropriate solvers found in the 'catkin_ws/src/rendezvous_problem/src'-directory
